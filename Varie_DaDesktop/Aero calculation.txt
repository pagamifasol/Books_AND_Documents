[Front Wheel Fz] +CONST(HCG)*CONST(Mass)*[GLongSmooth]/CONST(WB) +[Load Aero F Pit]

Front wheel Fz is the load at FL push w/o the static FL weight at wheel.
U could have this information in the pit lane when pit limiter is ON, PPS > 15, car_speed > 54 and < 63.

But U have to add Load of Aerospeed @60kph what is a theorical value from ScZF.

U have also to take in account the Load transfer
HCG is CoG height
Mass is car weight
Glongsmooth is Filtered Longitudinal Acc
WB is wheelbase

FrontWheel_Fz: 4.670+4.657
AeroLoadF_@60kph: ~Czf*A @ static RH (60/80) -> 3.7

RearWheel_Fz: 9.111+8.950
AeroLoadR_@60kph: ~Czr*A @ static RH (60/80) -> 2.137
